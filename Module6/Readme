Module 6. Collecting Device Operations into Functions

   A function is a device that groups a set of statements
   so they can be run more than once in a program. Functions
   also can compute a result value and let us specify parameters
   that serve as function inputs, which may differ each time the
   code is run.

   Functions are the most basic program structure Python provides
   for maximizing code reuse and minimizing code redundancy.
   
   A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used
   to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better
   modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
   
   The function performs a specific task. The advantages of using functions are:

    Reducing duplication of code
    Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces
    Improving clarity of the code
    Reuse of code
    Information hiding
   
   Functions can be assigned to variables, stored in collections or passed
   as arguments. This brings additional flexibility to the language.
   
   There are two basic types of functions.
   Built-in functions and user defined ones.
   The built-in functions are part of the Python language.
   The user defined functions are functions created with the def keyword.
