Module 10. Python with Databases


NOTE: Eclipse PyDev plugin has issues with resolving 'sqlite3' imports,
      complaining with "Undefined variable from import: ..." type of errors
      against multiple 'sqlite3' module members.
      Following is a fix that can be applied to the PyDev settings:
        Goto: Window->Preferences->PyDev->Interpreters->Python Interpreter
        Goto: Forced Builtins tab
        Click on New...
        Type '_sqlite3' (without quotes)
        Click OK

        Eclipse IDE might need to be restarted.

        The error messages will disappear, and the module members will also
        be recognized.
