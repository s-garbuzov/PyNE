# description:
# this file contains a list of switches on which we theoretically want to make changes
# it is not strictly necessary to begin a comment with a "#" due to the script's regular expression match used to determine a switch name
#      but using comment mark tells the reader your intention to make that line a comment
# as an alternative, you could ignore all lines read by the script that begin with a "#" using a different regular expression

# lab pod 1 switches
lab1-1.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com
lab1-2.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com
lab1-3.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com with extra info making it not conform to switch naming convention

# lab pod 2 switches
lab2-1.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com
lab2-2.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com

# lab pod 3 switches
lab3-1.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com
lab3-2.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com

# lab pod 4 switches
lab4-1.switch.cml-lab.cisco.com
