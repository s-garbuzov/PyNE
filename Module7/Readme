Module 7. Network Devices as Objects

Object-oriented programming overview
- simple network device object

Classes and objects
- device class and creation of device objects

Inheritance
- device hierarchy with base device class for product family,
  specific children, etc.

Overloading
- methods to get interface information, done differently
  depending on device and version

Encapsulation (data hiding)
- details of device hidden from application



Misc notes to be organized:

Classes are created with the class statement.
Roughly, classes are packages of functions that use and process
built-in object types. Classes, though, are designed to create and manage
new objects, and they also support inheritance - a mechanism of code
customization and reuse.
Classes are Python program units, just like functions and modules: they are
another compartment for packaging logic and data


Classes have three critical distinctions that make them more useful when it
comes to building new objects:
   o Multiple instances
     Classes are essentially factories for generating one or more objects.
     Every time we call a class, we generate a new object with a distinct
     namespace. Each object generated from a class has access to the class’s
     attributes and gets a namespace of its own for data that varies per object.
    
   o Customization via inheritance
     Classes also support the OOP notion of inheritance; we can extend a class
     by redefining its attributes outside the class itself. More generally,
     classes can build up namespace hierarchies, which define names to be used
     by objects created from classes in the hierarchy.
     

   o Operator overloading
     By providing special protocol methods, classes can define objects
     that respond to the sorts of operations we saw at work on built-in types.
     For instance, objects made with classes can be sliced, concatenated,
     indexed, and so on. Python provides hooks that classes can use to
     intercept and implement any built-in type operation.


Most of the OOP story in Python boils down to this expression:

object.attribute

When classes are involved, the preceding Python expression effectively
translates to the following in natural language:
   Find the first occurrence of attribute by looking in object, then in all
   classes above it, from bottom to top and left to right.

Notice that in the Python object model, classes and the instances you generate
from them are two distinct object types:

  o Classes
   Serve as instance factories. Their attributes provide behavior, data and
   functions, that is inherited by all the instances generated from them
   (e.g., a function to compute an employee’s salary from pay and hours).
   
  o Instances
   Represent the concrete items in a program’s domain. Their attributes
   record data that varies per specific object (e.g., an employee’s Social
   Security number).

In terms of search trees, an instance inherits attributes from its class,
and a class inherits attributes from all classes above it in the tree.

Classes higher in the tree are called as "superclasses" (or "base classes"),
classes lower in the tree are called as "subclasses" (or "derived classes")


The primary difference between classes and instances is that classes are
a kind of factory for generating instances.


Python automatically calls a method named __init__ each time an instance is
generated from a class.
The __init__ method is known as the constructor, because of when it is run

There is always an implied subject in functions within a class,
usually the “self” keyword is used as the reference to this object
instance.

When a def appears inside a class it is known as a method,
and it automatically receives a special first argument, called "self" by
convention, that provides a handle back to the instance to be processed.
When a method assigns to a "self" attribute, it creates or changes an
attribute in an instance at the bottom of the class tree  because "self"
automatically refers to the instance being processed.
